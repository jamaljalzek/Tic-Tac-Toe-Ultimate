# Tic_Tac_Toe_Ultimate
This is a game (written in Java) that is essentially single player Tic Tac Toe, but with a few added features.

More specifically:

Unlike traditional Tic Tac Toe, you are not limited to a 3 x 3 grid. Instead, you may choose anywhere from a 3 x 3 all the way up
to a 10 x 10 game board.
<br>As mentioned, this is a single player game, where your opponent is the computer. As such, one of the main features of this game is
that you may choose from 3 different difficulties:
1.  EASY - Easy to play against (and easy for me to program), the computer randomly picks a spot on the game grid and ends its
turn.
2.  MEDIUM - The computer now has a strategy to win. Like a person, it finds the row, column, or diagonal that is closest to being
completed (by the computer, with no player markers present), and randomly chooses a spot in said row, column, or diagonal.
3.  HARD - Basically MEDIUM mode, but with added offensive behavior: the computer will block you if you are one move away from
completing a row, column, or diagonal. The only way to win on this mode is to use a strategy that leads to a situation where
you have two different ways of winning during a single turn.
